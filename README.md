## Python version

- **It is recommended to use Python 3.7.**

- There is a nice summary of new features on [Real Python](https://realpython.com/python37-new-features). More detailed description can be found in [official docs](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.7.html).

    - A very powerful new feature are [Data Classes](https://realpython.com/python-data-classes), which can easily replace [namedtuples](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/collections.html#collections.namedtuple) and [attrs](https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs).
    
    - [Typing Forward Reference](https://realpython.com/python37-new-features/#typing-enhancements) may also improve your code if are using type hints (which you should!).
    
- If for some reason you are using previous versions of Python (especially version 3.6), it is possible to backport some features e.g. [Data Classes](https://github.com/ericvsmith/dataclasses).
